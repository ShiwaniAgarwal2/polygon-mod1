# MODULE 1 PROJECT

This project showcases the fundamental syntax and functionalities of Solidity, alongside JavaScript, in the development of a simple smart contract and NFT collection deployment.

## Description

The project focuses on creating a smart contract using Solidity, commonly used for Ethereum blockchain development. The goals of this project include:
1. Generating a 5-item NFT collection using tools like DALLE 2 or Midjourney.
2. Uploading the generated images to IPFS via Pinata.cloud or a similar platform.
3. Deploying either an ERC721 or ERC1155 contract on the Goerli Ethereum Testnet.
4. Implementing a `promptDescription` function within the contract to return the prompt used for image generation.
5. Optionally mapping the NFT collection using Polygon's token mapper for better visualization.
6. Writing a Hardhat script to batch mint NFTs, with ERC721A recommended for efficiency.
7. Developing a Hardhat script to transfer the NFTs from Ethereum Sepolia to Polygon Amoy using the FxPortal Bridge.
8. Ensuring the NFTs are approved for transfer.
9. Depositing the NFTs to the Bridge.
10. Testing the `balanceOf` function on the Amoy network.

This project serves as an introduction to Solidity, blockchain development, and NFT creation, and can be a solid foundation for more advanced projects.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the MetaMask wallet on your browser.
2. Add both the Sepolia and Amoy test networks to MetaMask using Chainlist (https://chainlist.org/?testnets=true). Enable 'Include Testnets,' search for Sepolia (Chain ID: 11155111), and add it to MetaMask. Then, search for Amoy (Chain ID: 80002) and add it as well.
3. Obtain testnet tokens. For Sepolia, use Google’s Sepolia faucet (https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia), and for Amoy, use the Polygon faucet (https://faucet.polygon.technology/), which requires joining Polygon’s Discord.
4. Clone the GitHub repository, ensuring all files are present.
5. Open the project directory in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
6. In the terminal, run `npm i` to install the required dependencies.
7. Store your private key in the `.env` file.
8. Deploy the contract using the command: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia`.
9. Replace the token address in other scripts with the deployed contract address.
10. Mint the NFTs by running: `npx hardhat run scripts/mint.js --network sepolia`.
11. Approve and deposit the NFTs to Polygon using: `npx hardhat run scripts/approveDeposit.js --network sepolia`.
12. Wait 20-30 minutes for the NFTs to appear in your Polygon account.
13. Use https://www.oklink.com/amoy to verify your NFTs and retrieve the contract address for Polygon.
14. Update the contract address in the `getBalance` script and run: `npx hardhat run scripts/getBalance.js --network amoy` to check your new NFT balance.
15. Use the `prompt.js` script to view all image URLs and prompt descriptions: `npx hardhat run scripts/prompt.js --network sepolia`.
16. Your project is complete!
